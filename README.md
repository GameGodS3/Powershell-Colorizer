# PowerShell Colourizer

Windows Powershell is the strongest shell in the Windows Operating System and yet it is limited from customisation and colours due to its definite 16 colour values.

This script makes it easier for you to add custom colours to the PowerShell colour palette by just entering the Hex Value of the colour you want to add.

Simply download __hexadjust.ps1__ and run it (by double clicking or by executing it within PowerShell)
